# Amazon Rekognition

In this example we use Amazon Rekogntion to read vehicle license plates. The process usually comprises two steps:
Finding the license plate in the image, i.e. creating a bounding box to crop the image around the plate; and
Perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the cropped image.

For this project we provide a dataset of about 1,800 license plates with an image of the vehicle, a gray-scale image of the license plate, and the license number. The data were collected using a commercial license plate reader (LPR) in the Atlanta area.
