# Natural Language Processing with Amazon Comprehend


Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to discover insights from text. Amazon Comprehend provides Keyphrase Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling, and Language Detection APIs so you can easily integrate natural language processing into your applications.

The APIs will output entities, key phrases, sentiment, and language in a JSON format, which you can use in your application.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
The Sentiment Analysis API returns the overall sentiment of a text (Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed).
- **Syntax Analysis:**
The Amazon Comprehend Syntax API enables customers to analyze text using tokenization and Parts of Speech (PoS), and identify word boundaries and labels like nouns and adjectives within the text.
- **Entity Recognition:**
The Entity Recognition API returns the named entities ("People," "Places," "Locations," etc.) that are automatically categorized based on the provided text.
