# Build, train, deploy, and monitor a machine learning model

In this tutorial, we use Amazon SageMaker Studio to build, train, deploy, and monitor an XGBoost model. You cover the entire machine learning (ML) workflow from feature engineering and model training to batch and live deployments for ML models.

We are using the "default of credit card clients" data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients
